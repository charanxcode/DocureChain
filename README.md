# 📄 DocureChain

**"Secure Identity. Verified Nation."**  
A blockchain-powered mobile app for secure document verification and digital identity protection. Inspired by DigiLocker.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DocureChain** is an open-source mobile application that leverages **blockchain**, **IPFS**, and **Flutter** to provide a trusted and tamper-proof platform for document storage and verification.

In today's digital age, documents are frequently shared for identity or academic verification—but they’re often vulnerable to tampering or unauthorized usage. DocureChain solves this by offering **a decentralized, user-first approach to document verification**.

**DocureChain** aims to solve this by providing:
- Immutable storage on **IPFS**
- Tamper-proof document verification using **smart contracts**
- Secure user-friendly mobile app built with **Flutter**
