# 📄 DocureChain

**"Secure Identity. Verified Nation."**  
A blockchain-powered mobile app for secure document verification and digital identity protection. Inspired by DigiLocker.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DocureChain** is an open-source mobile application that leverages **blockchain**, **IPFS**, and **cross-platform technologies** like **Flutter** and **React Native** to provide a trusted and tamper-proof platform for document storage and verification.

In today's digital age, documents are frequently shared for identity or academic verification—but they’re often vulnerable to tampering or unauthorized usage. DocureChain solves this by offering **a decentralized, user-first approach to document verification**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> Every day, we share personal documents at colleges, government offices, job interviews, and private organizations. These documents can be copied, misused, or manipulated.

**DocureChain** aims to solve this by providing:
- Immutable storage on **IPFS**
- Tamper-proof document verification using **smart contracts**
- A secure, user-friendly mobile app using modern cross-platform frameworks
